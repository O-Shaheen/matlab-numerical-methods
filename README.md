MATLAB toolbox containing 5 numerical methods for analysis of projectile motion.


In this project, I developed a toolbox that is utilized to fire a projectile to land on a specific target.  Here, I created a differential equation that describes the projectile's path while accounting for air resistance. The angle at which the projectile should be launched will then be determined using the shooting method. The project has two versions. One without reliance on MATLAB built-in functions and the other is based on MALTAB functions. Number of numerical methods are used to solve each part of the problem separately. We first implemented numerical integration methods, both Trapezoid as well as Simpsonâ€™s.  We then used quadratic interpolation, Gauss Jordan as well as Trapezoid integration to calculate the total length of the projectile path. In the second part we measured the resultant velocity and angle of the projectile using numerical differentiation methods. In the third part we incorporated air resistance in calculating the projectile velocities (vx & Vy) vs time. Lastly, we integrated all the tools together in addition to using the shooting method to identify the initial velocity of the projectile in order to hit a specified target.
